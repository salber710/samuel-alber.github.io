I am currently a CS PhD student at Stanford researching physics-inspired machine learning methods for analyzing complex biological systems. There, I am supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP). Previously, I studied computer science and physics at UC Berkeley, where I worked in the labs of Nir Yosef and Elior Rahmani on developing robust statistical methods for analyzing single-cell data. For this research, I was awarded a Barry Goldwater Scholarship.
